# Knowns and Unknowns
 About the known_and_unknown issues
 
# “我们知道一些我们知道的事情。我们还知道一些很明显的未知事情。那就是说，我们知道有些事情我们不知道。但还有一些没人知道的未知事情——也就是我们不知道的未知事情。”

# “As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know . We also know there are known unknows; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don't know we don't know.”
